# 🧠 Deep Learning Projects Collection

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Repository** — a curated collection of practical and educational projects covering core NLP (Natural Language Processing) and DL (Deep Learning) concepts.  
Each notebook explores different techniques and libraries used to process, analyze, and understand human language.

## 📘 Repository Overview

This repository contains a set of hands-on implementations of deep learning and NLP techniques, ranging from text preprocessing to integration with OpenAI and spaCy.

| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **NER_Spacy_OpenAI_Integration_DL** | Combines **spaCy’s Named Entity Recognition (NER)** with **OpenAI’s GPT models** to enhance entity detection and contextual understanding. Demonstrates hybrid NLP pipeline creation. |
| **Sentiment_Analysis_nltk_vader_DL** | Implements **sentiment analysis** using **VADER (NLTK)** and a **Deep Learning model**, comparing lexicon-based vs neural network approaches. |
| **Stemming_Lemmatization_** | Explores **text normalization techniques** like stemming and lemmatization. Includes visualizations and performance comparisons for preprocessing text data efficiently. |
| **Word_Embeddings_** | Demonstrates **word embeddings** (Word2Vec, GloVe, and custom embeddings). Covers vector representations of words and how they capture semantic relationships. |
